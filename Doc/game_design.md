# Design Doc for The TOMB of the SWORD

### Goals

The TOMB of the SWORD is a beginner's attempt at making a video game and incorporating a narrative with interaction. Thus, I want to focus on a simple combat system and a relatively simple story. My goals are:
* A functioning combat system.
* NPCs that one can expand on the story.
* Monsters that can be examined.
* A sufficiently epic final boss.

### Story

The world is in ruin. Your kingdom's castle lies infested with kingly corpses and demonic monsters. You survived the end by fleeing into the forests, but a storm has forced you to seek shelter. You find the entrance to some large crypt, and, fearing what dwells deeper in the forest and above the storm clouds, you enter to rest. The last thing you see before some mystical weariness overtakes you is the image of a black, runed sword . . .


### Mechanics
* Choose-your own adventure elements.
* Researching monsters to increase their weaknesses.
* Advance dialogue system

### Wishes
* To install multiple states into the game.
  * One such state similar to a text-based adventure.
* Let the player drive the narrative meaningfully.
